## Intro

"We dont see the forest because of all the trees." (german saying, roughly translated)

In frontend, its the other way around, we stray through the forest of frameworks and dont see the big mother Redwoodtree - the DOM.

We deal with lots of data flows, from the backend to the user and back. These flows can be trivial, but most of the time, they are not, 
so they need an elaborated architecture and testing. The question is, where do we put the logic if a table in the ui shows 
joined data from several API calls? How to orchestrate a filter composition? Where to put form display logic? We will 
address these questions, and propose a solution at least for the simplest one. 

On the example of a form with input fields, we will compare a view and controller approach with a tree based approach. 
Next we will write tests for both. There will be proof of concept code, and also one real world example. 
Later comes some discussion about other architecture styles, and a glimpse on more complicated architectural questions. 

Disclaimer: You wont see any new ideas in this article. Programming is old enough to have solved every possible problem, 
and also old enough for having forgotten these solutions. So we just write a reminder. ðŸ˜‰

## Example form

We have a form with two input fields I1 and I2, both of them are select fields. There are constraints: 
- I1 can only have values following the rules of C1. 
- I2 can only have values following the rules of C2.
- The form is valid if both fields are valid and the combination of both fields is valid, that is described by C12.

@todo concrete funny example.... two pets? clothes? two dishes for dinner?    
- To illlustrate the actual form example, it would help to present it as an actual example rather than I1, C1, etc. If it's "If the user selects cat, we want to know what kind of cat it is", or something, because that's going to be easier for the reader to grasp than a diagrammed flow chart.

## View and Controller

Simplified MVC / MVVM .

Not what its meant to be, but what we often see in large projects. 

## Tree based

## Pros and cons


## @todos .... 


Why should I care? 

Different architekture patterns applied to frontend. 

Testing with nullables

DOM

dont split view and logic

never stateless

component based arch

WHERE is MVC? not globally, but locally in every component. 


- forms
- filters
- copy&paste -> decorators

debugging with dev tools leads directly to right component

bei zentraler logik passt weger model noch prop (https://git.bihealth.org/llp/llp/-/merge_requests/674#note_285461)

different types of nodes
layout, inner node, root, leaf
