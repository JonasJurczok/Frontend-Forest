In Germany we say: "Wir sehen den Wald vor lauter BÃ¤umen nicht." - "We dont see the forest because of all the trees."

In Frontend, its the other way around, we stray through the forest of frameworks and dont see the big mother mamuth tree - the DOM.

This article is about the DOM, which may guide us on the right path towards a frontend architecture independent of the framework.



Why should I care? 

Different architekture patterns applied to frontend. 

Testing with nullables

DOM

dont split view and logic

never stateless

component based arch

- forms
- filters
- copy&paste -> decorators

debugging with dev tools leads directly to right component

bei zentraler logik passt weger model noch prop (https://git.bihealth.org/llp/llp/-/merge_requests/674#note_285461)

different types of nodes
layout, inner node, root, leaf
